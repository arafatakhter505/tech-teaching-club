    "des": "In this course you will learn how to become a C++ Object-Oriented programmer by learning to do programming hands-on. This course is easy to understand and will take you from not knowing any C++ Object-Oriented Programming to becoming proficient in the C++ language. The terminology is simply to understand and taught in easy to understand plain English.You will walk through c++ source code, compile and run the examples to get a full understanding of the topics. This course is expected to take about a week (40 hours) to complete if you go through the entire examples.The lectures are structures in a step-by-step fashion to make the concept easily understandable with solid examples.You should take this course to help you learn one of the hottest programming languages in use today in industry.",
